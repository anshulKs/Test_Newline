// The selenium server file is included in the directory. Make sure to build path to the .jar file.

// The chromedriver is included in the directory. By default, it can be pasted in the C: Drive to execute the code.
// Otherwise use the following command in the setUp() method-

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "PATH_TO_CHROMEDRIVER.EXE");

// This command is used to tell the project about the location of chromedriver, as openqa.selenium* fetches it.
// It can detect by default as well, but just in case it doesn't specify the path.
// It is used to avoid any browser and driver version conflicts.
